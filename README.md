AB-testing-Cookie-cats
Cookie Cats is a hugely popular mobile puzzle game developed by Tactile Entertainment.
As players progress through the levels of the game, they will occasionally encounter gates that force them to wait a non-trivial amount of time or make an in-app purchase to progress. 
Initially the first gate was placed at level 30, but in this notebook we're going to analyze an AB-test where we moved the first gate in Cookie Cats from level 30 to level 40. In particular, we will look at the impact on player retention.
